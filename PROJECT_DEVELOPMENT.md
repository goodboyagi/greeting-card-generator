# üé® Greeting Card Generator - Project Development Roadmap

## üìã Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Core functionality**: AI-powered text generation with GPT-5o-mini
- ‚úÖ **Image generation**: DALL-E 3 integration with enhanced prompts
- ‚úÖ **Combined system**: Predefined prompts + AI object extraction
- ‚úÖ **Analytics**: Usage tracking and statistics dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Production deployment**: GitHub Pages + Render backend

## üöÄ High Priority Features

### 1. **Image Upload & Composition (KILLER FEATURE)**
**Why this is amazing:**
- ‚úÖ **Unique selling point** - No other free generator does this
- ‚úÖ **Highly personalized** - Real photos make cards special
- ‚úÖ **Memory integration** - Users can include meaningful moments
- ‚úÖ **Technical wow factor** - AI image composition is cutting-edge

**Implementation approach:**
1. **Frontend**: Image upload + commentary fields
2. **Backend**: Image processing + DALL-E image composition
3. **AI**: Extract elements from uploaded images and blend them into generated image

**Technical considerations:**
- Image size limits (maybe 5MB per image, max 3 images)
- Image format validation (JPG, PNG)
- Privacy/security for uploaded images
- DALL-E prompt enhancement with image descriptions

**User flow:**
1. User uploads 1-3 images
2. User adds commentary for each image
3. AI analyzes images and extracts key elements
4. DALL-E generates image incorporating uploaded elements
5. Final card includes both AI-generated and user-provided visual elements

### 2. **Sender Name & Signature**
**Current**: "With warmest regards, Good Boy AGI"
**New**: "With warmest regards, [Sender Name]"
