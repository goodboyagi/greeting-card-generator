## 🚀 High Priority Features

### 1. **Image Upload & Composition (KILLER FEATURE)**
**Why this is amazing:**
- ✅ **Unique selling point** - No other free generator does this
- ✅ **Highly personalized** - Real photos make cards special
- ✅ **Memory integration** - Users can include meaningful moments
- ✅ **Technical wow factor** - AI image composition is cutting-edge

**Implementation approach:**
1. **Frontend**: Image upload + commentary fields
2. **Backend**: Image processing + DALL-E image composition
3. **AI**: Extract elements from uploaded images and blend them into generated image

**Technical considerations:**
- Image size limits (maybe 5MB per image, max 3 images)
- Image format validation (JPG, PNG)
- Privacy/security for uploaded images
- DALL-E prompt enhancement with image descriptions

**User flow:**
1. User uploads 1-3 images
2. User adds commentary for each image
3. AI analyzes images and extracts key elements
4. DALL-E generates image incorporating uploaded elements
5. Final card includes both AI-generated and user-provided visual elements

### 2. **Style Templates**
- Choose from different card layouts/styles
- Modern, vintage, minimalist, ornate options
- Different aspect ratios (square, landscape, portrait)

### 3. **Multi-language Support**
